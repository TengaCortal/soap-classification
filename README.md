# Machine Learning based SOAP Classification System

This project involves the development of a Machine Learning based SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) classification system. For the moment, the provided code processes SOAP data stored in CSV files, performs various preprocessing tasks, and extracts useful information for analysis and classification.

For detailed instructions on running the scripts and understanding their output, refer to the respective README files in the subdirectories.
